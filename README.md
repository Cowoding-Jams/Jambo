# Jam Bot

This bot is made to autonomously manage a discord server with regular game jams/hackathons.  
It will collect the proposals for the jam, create polls for everyone to participate (with reactions directly on the server) and will give the server some more glamour with color roles for example.
You can read about the full set of features in our wiki [here](https://github.com/Wonderful-bot/Jam-Bot/wiki#overview-of-all-the-features).
